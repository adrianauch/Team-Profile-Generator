1. build folder structure and install necessary libraries, npm init -y, git init etc
2. build 4 test files, Employee, Engineer, Intern, Manager....first time tests run they should fail, no code has been built yet, think about what you need to test? does a new object get created when you call the class? does the name, email, id arguments get set as key/value pairs on the object
   think about what class is the parent? they are all employees and all will have name, id, email, engineer, intern, manager will be sub classes
3. build out questions for team manager based on requirements
   please build your team, what is your managers name?
   what is the team managers id?
   what is the team managers email?
   what is the team managers office number?
   which type of team member would you like to add? Engineer, Intern, I dont want to add any more team members
   test that a managers object was created from the class with the correct data!!!!
4. create a base static HTML layout for the cards
5. build out the manager card with manager object dynamically
6. Next work on engineer object based on user input
7. next work on intern object based on user input
   going to need a function that generates the html - you can use template literals - have one js file for this, and export function to generate entire page
   for the main index js file, import all classes, create an empty array for teamMembers and idArray,
   grab input for manager and call that class to create an object, then call another function to create team, for this function use a switch statement to determine whether the user wants to create an engineer or intern and called the appropriate functions in cases.
   finally, call a funciton if they dont want to create any more team members and call the function to render the HTML to build the team
